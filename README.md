# Twimba
Twitter clone from Scrimba lesson

I added some of my touch for the stretch goals, including: 
1. Add the ability to reply to a specific tweet
2. Allow usert to delete their tweet
3. Add dark mode

I have decided to write down what I have learned from my projects to make it easier for myself if I wanna refresh my memory later in the future.

New methods learned to make this project:
- textarea
- forEach()
- data attributes
- conditionally render styles
- NOT operator (!)
- CDNs: add icons & generate UUIDs
